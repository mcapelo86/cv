## Senior Product Manager at Talkdesk

*Jan 2021 - Present (Portugal / US-based company)*

I’m the lead product manager for Talkdesk’s Healthcare & Life Sciences products. I’m responsible for translating our strategic goals into a clear roadmap of opportunities and for ensuring its execution, overseeing the work of two product managers.

Since I’ve joined Talkdesk, we’ve launched a new product for healthcare provider organizations and successfully onboarded our first customers. Additionally, I led the definition of a new cross-vertical product development process for my business unit.

## Product Manager & Team Leader at Aptoide

*Sep 2019 - Dec 2020 (Portugal)*

I led Aptoide’s web-based products across 3 product & engineering teams composed of 15 people, namely software developers, QA analysts and product experts (product designers, SEO expert, app security & compliance specialist).

During this time, we were able to improve the website acquisition and conversion rate leading to a 2x increase in ads monetization. In the API domain, we were able to scale the number of requests of a crucial service to app distributors by 1.000x.

## Product Manager at Moteefe

*Apr 2019 - Aug 2019 (Portugal / UK-based company)*

I was responsible for setting up a new area focused on optimizing the performance of Moteefe’s e-commerce website, particularly its conversion rate and average order value. This also included the procurement and integration of new payment gateways.

During my time at Moteefe, we were able to develop and start a 6-month plan for optimizing each customer journey step based on an iterative A/B testing approach. I also had the opportunity to define and start monitoring a set of business and product metrics.

## Co-Founder and Head of Product at peeq

*Sep 2016 - Feb 2019 (Portugal)*

I co-founded peeq and led the team behind its development. I was mainly focused on managing the full product lifecycle, from idea to launch. Other areas of responsibility included business development, customer service and software development.

During this time, we launched and monetized two mobile apps for parents and daycares (iOS and Android). We participated in two start-up accelerator programs: Vodafone’s Power Lab and Beta-i’s Lisbon Challenge.
